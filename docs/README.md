#### How to read this manual

- Words in `monospace` are commands that you should type in the chatbot.
- Words between `<` and `>` are placeholders for **required** arguments that you should replace with actual values. For example, `<task>` should be replaced with the actual task description.
- Words between `[` and `]` are placeholders for **optional** arguments that you may include or omit. For example, `[command]` means that the command name is optional.
- Aliases can be used to refer to the same command. For example, "Aliases: `list`, `ls`" means that you can use either `list` or `ls` to list all tasks.
